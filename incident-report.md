**Report ID:** IR20230803-002  
**Date:** August 3, 2023  
**Time of Incident:** August 2, 2023, 06:01 GMT+3  

**Type of Incident:** Sophisticated phishing attack  

**Summary:**  
A sophisticated phishing attempt was reported on August 2, 2023, at 06:01 GMT+3. The incident involved Georgia's iOS device and was conducted via the Signal messaging application. 

**Details of the Incident:**  
The incident involved an unidentified account sending Georgia a suspicious message on Signal. The message content was: "how was your trip to UK." Although the message appeared generic, the relevance to Georgia's personal information classified it as a phishing attempt.

The account used for this phishing attempt was particularly noteworthy due to its lack of an associated phone number - a requirement typically enforced when creating a Signal account. This lack of identifiable information increased the sophistication of the attack.

The incident was monitored for 24 hours to understand the attacker's intentions. After the observation period, the account was subsequently blocked.

**Impact:**  
No direct harm or data breach occurred as a result of the phishing attempt. The sophisticated nature of the attack, however, reveals an emerging threat to user data security. 

**Investigation & Response:**  
Upon investigation, it was discovered that Signal is currently developing a feature that would allow users to hide their phone numbers. Evidence of this feature was found in the source code of the application. It is speculated that the attacker may have exploited this upcoming feature or found a way to simulate it.

This phishing attempt has been categorized as a sophisticated attack due to its utilization of advanced methods of identity concealment.

**Next Steps:**  
We recommend further monitoring for similar incidents and the development of strategies to combat this emerging threat. Users should be made aware of the possibility of such attacks and trained on how to recognize and report them.
